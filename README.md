## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design - Module 3 paired project.

The project was Rancid Tomatillos, a hybrid between the film review platform Rotten Tomatoes and a popular streaming service, like Netflix or Hulu. On page load, users will see a library of newly-released movies and can search by title, genre, or overview keywords to narrow down this library. Clicking on an individual movie will take the user to a Movie Details page which displays the movie title, tagline, overview, genres, release date, run time, average rating, budget and revenue details, as well as relevant movie clips or trailers.

The goal of this project was to create an app using the React JavaScript framework, class and functional components, a controlled Form, React Router to mimic a multi-page application, multiple network requests to source our data, and to follow Test-Driven Development best practices by implementing automated end-to-end testing via the Cypress testing framework.
