## Overview

This is a Turing School of Software and Design - Module 3 paired project.

The project was Rancid Tomatillos, a hybrid between the film review platform Rotten Tomatoes and a popular streaming service, like Netflix or Hulu. On page load, users will see a library of newly-released movies and can search by title, genre, or overview keywords to narrow down this library. Clicking on an individual movie will take the user to a Movie Details page which displays the movie title, tagline, overview, genres, release date, run time, average rating, budget and revenue details, as well as relevant movie clips or trailers.

The goal of this project was to create an app using the React JavaScript framework, class and functional components, a controlled Form, React Router to mimic a multi-page application, multiple network requests to source our data, and to follow Test-Driven Development best practices by implementing automated end-to-end testing via the Cypress testing framework.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
